Agents
Whilst the Enterprise Search and summarisation features alone offer significant value to an organisation through improved workforce efficiency, increased productivity and the associated cost savings, Agentspace becomes an incredibly powerful tool when you start to factor in agents. 
Agents in Agentspace are specialised AI assistants designed to perform complex, multi-step tasks or automate entire business processes, often combining information retrieval with reasoning and actions.
Out of the box, Agentspace is configured with Google’s DeepResearch agent- an agent that performs deep analysis on a topic, returning a plan for review prior to execution. Upon approval, Agentspace will then run the plan, and return a detailed report on the topic in question.

As Agentspace approaches GA, I expect to see Google releasing more preconfigured agents but more importantly, Agentspace caters for custom agents.
Custom Agents
Custom agents will offer maximum value to enterprises by tailoring Agents to specific business needs. Its likely most unique business processes will require custom agents to meet the nuances of the organisation. Grounded in enterprise data sources, agents leverage the company data and configured tools, to achieve the desired goal. Agent creation typically involves several steps:
1.	Define the goal/instructions: Define what the agent is meant to achieve in natural language.
2.	Tools/Actions available: Specify what capabilities the agent has: defining external APIs it can call or what predefined "Actions" it can execute and whether it can interact with specific Connectors.
3.	Link Data Sources: Connect the agent to relevant enterprise knowledge via configured Connectors.
Interaction with custom agents all occurs within the single Agentspace UI, with agents appearing under a dedicated menu section. Users then interact with the agent using natural conversation via the chat interface.
Agent Security
Security is paramount when custom agents interact with other systems. For agents performing tasks initiated directly by a user, like the expense claim example, Agentspace typically operates under the delegated authority of the logged-in user. This means when the agent submits the expense data, it leverages the user's authenticated session with the target expense system. This user-centric approach ensures the agent inherently respects that individual's permissions and limits within the target application, and actions can be clearly audited back to the initiating user. Any specific credentials needed for tools or APIs called by the agent should integrate with secure stores like Google Secret Manager.

Security is paramount when custom agents interact with other systems, and Agentspace provides flexibility to handle different scenarios. For agents performing tasks initiated directly by a user, like the expense claim example, the platform typically operates under the delegated authority of the logged-in user. This user-centric approach leverages the user's authenticated session with the target expense system, ensuring the agent inherently respects that individual's permissions and limits within the target application, and allows actions to be clearly audited back to the initiating user. 
Alternatively, for background processes, scheduled automations, or system-level integrations not triggered by an immediate user action, agents can be configured to utilize dedicated service accounts. These service accounts operate with their own specific IAM permissions, granted independently and carefully managed according to the principle of least privilege. Regardless of whether user delegation or a service account is used, any specific credentials needed for tools or APIs called by the agent should integrate with secure stores like Google Secret Manager to ensure proper handling.
Agent Example Use Case
An example agent I have been developing involves simplifying expense claim submissions.
Depending upon the system and the users experience submitting expenses claims, this can be a time-consuming and challenging process. For users that don’t frequently submit expenses, they need to find documentation or a colleague to guide them through the process (something that could be done via Enterprise Search in Agentspace with a simple KB article etc.). Once they have identified the system, they then need to authenticate and then navigate the UI submitting and classifying the expense claim.
With a custom agent, this process can be simplified and managed from within Agentspace UI. The user uploads an image of a receipt they want to claim expenses for to the Expenses agent. The agent detects the image as a receipt, extracts the date, items and cost of the items which are then used to classify the expense type. Provided the expense aligns with the defined expense policy, the agent then submits the extracted data alongside additional information it knows about the user e.g. name, email address, and prompts the user to validate the detected information is correct, and add any missing mandatory data not stored within the user profile or receipt e.g. cost centers. The agent then transfers the data to JSON, prior to submitting the expense request to the corresponding system. The agent then emails confirmation of the expense claim to the user, providing a record of the transaction alongside links to documentation for expense FAQs.
This provides a better customer experience for the person submitting the expense claim, improves efficiency as the entire process is managed and guided by the agent who is available 24/7, and caters for validation and correct submission of expense claims reducing the likely hood of user error due to inexperience.
